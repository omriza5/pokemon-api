# Pokémon API Terminal App

## Description

This is a terminal-based application where users can interactively retrieve information about various Pokémon. The app asks the user to "draw" a Pokémon (i.e., input a Pokémon's name or ID) and then fetches the corresponding details such as type, abilities, stats, etc. This interaction continues in a loop until the user decides to exit by pressing 'No'. The app leverages external Pokémon APIs to retrieve real-time data, ensuring an engaging and informative experience.

## Stack

- Python
- Boto3
- AWS

## Challenges

One of the main challenges was automating certain aspects of the project using **Boto3**, AWS's SDK for Python. This included resource provisioning and management through AWS services, adding complexity to the automation process.

## What Have I Learned?

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
- AWS Automation using Boto3

## Plans for the Future

The next step is to evolve this terminal app into a web-based application by building a **React** front-end and hosting it on AWS, ensuring a seamless and scalable user experience.
